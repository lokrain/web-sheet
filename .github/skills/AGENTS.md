# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT 5.2, Cursor, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

A collection of skills for AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot Chat, ChatGPT 5.2, etc.) for working with Vercel deployments. Skills are packaged instructions and scripts that extend the assistant's capabilities.

## Creating a New Skill

### Directory Structure

```
.github/skills/
  {skill-name}/           # kebab-case directory name
    SKILL.md              # Required: skill definition
    scripts/              # Required: executable scripts
      {script-name}.sh    # Bash scripts (preferred)
  {skill-name}.zip        # Required: packaged for distribution
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Skill directory**: `kebab-case` (e.g., `vercel-deploy`, `log-monitor`)
- **SKILL.md**: Always uppercase, always this exact filename
- **Scripts**: `kebab-case.sh` (e.g., `deploy.sh`, `fetch-logs.sh`)
- **Zip file**: Must match directory name exactly: `{skill-name}.zip`

### SKILL.md Format

````markdown
---
name: { skill-name }
description:
  {
    One sentence describing when to use this skill. Include trigger phrases like "Deploy my app",
    "Check logs",
    etc.,
  }
---

# {Skill Title}

{Brief description of what the skill does.}

## How It Works

{Numbered list explaining the skill's workflow}

## Usage

```bash
bash .github/skills/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh [args]
```
````

**Arguments:**

- `arg1` - Description (defaults to X)

**Examples:**
{Show 2-3 common usage patterns}

## Output

{Show example output users will see}

## Present Results to User

{Template for how the assistant should format results when presenting to users (for GitHub Copilot Chat / ChatGPT 5.2)}

## Troubleshooting

{Common issues and solutions, especially network/permissions errors}

### Best Practices for Context Efficiency

Skills are loaded on-demand — only the skill name and description are loaded at startup. The full `SKILL.md` loads into context only when the agent decides the skill is relevant. To minimize context usage:

- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** — put detailed reference material in separate files
- **Write specific descriptions** — helps the agent know exactly when to activate the skill
- **Use progressive disclosure** — reference supporting files that get read only when needed
- **Prefer scripts over inline code** — script execution doesn't consume context (only output does)
**File references work one level deep** — link directly from SKILL.md to supporting files

### Script Requirements

### Script Requirements

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Use `set -e` for fail-fast behavior
- Write status messages to stderr: `echo "Message" >&2`
- Write machine-readable output (JSON) to stdout
- Include a cleanup trap for temp files
- Reference the script path as `.github/skills/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh`

### Creating the Zip Package

After creating or updating a skill:

```bash
cd .github/skills
zip -r {skill-name}.zip {skill-name}/
````

If the `zip` CLI is not available, you can package with Python:

```bash
python3 -m zipfile -c {skill-name}.zip {skill-name}/
```

### End-User Installation

Document these installation methods for users:

**GitHub Copilot Chat (VS Code):**

- Keep the skill folder in the repo under `.github/skills/{skill-name}/`.
- In Copilot Chat, reference files directly (for example, “use .github/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md”).

**ChatGPT 5.2:**

- Upload `.github/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` (and any referenced files) to your ChatGPT Project / workspace.
- Or zip the folder and upload the zip.

If the skill requires network access, ensure your environment allows the required outbound domains.
